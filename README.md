Hi and welcome to Steven Craig's portfolio!!

If you're here you are most likely considering me for employment!

Anyway there are a few projects in this portfolio listed from newest to oldest. You should see from my progression that from every completed project I always critique what I find is lacking and aim to improve on the next project, whilst also adding in a new technology (or 3!).

If you do check this out I am very open to criticism, although I prefer the constructive kind! So please feel free to offer up any.

Thanks.

Steven

Memory-Game: <br>
https://github.com/WhiskyToad/memory-game<br>
https://whiskytoad.github.io/memory-game

Description:<br> A little game of memory, pick each one only once! I tried to jazz it up and make it a bit more card and game like than what the inital project idea was looking for, oh and I got to include some ace mountain bike photos! Enjoyed the simplicity and problem solving to get 3 different cards with one not chosen!

Technology:<br> React

Technology: <br>Vanilla JS
