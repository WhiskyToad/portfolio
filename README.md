Hi and welcome to Steven Craig's portfolio!!1!

If you're here you are most likely considering me for employment, so yay go me!

Anyway there are a few projects in this portfolio listed from newest to oldest. You should see from my progression that from every completed project I always critique what I find is lacking and aim to improve on the next project, whilst also adding in a new technology (or 3!).

If you do check this out I am very open to criticism, although I prefer the constructive kind! So please feel free to offer up any.

Thanks.

Steven

Shopping Cart:<br>
https://github.com/WhiskyToad/shopping-cart<br>
https://whiskytoad.github.io/shopping-cart/#/

Description: Just an example of a shop page, includes a meme generator (why not?), redux with persist state so the basket doesn't disappear. Item page dynamically loading whichever item you click and more nifty little things I've probably forgot! Currently not mobile friendly but I plan to come back to it to practice my refractoring skills for the real world jobs (Is a project ever truly finished?)

Technology: React Redux Hashrouter And More

Memory-Game: 
https://github.com/WhiskyToad/memory-game
https://whiskytoad.github.io/memory-game

Description: A little game of memory, pick each one only once! I tried to jazz it up and make it a bit more card and game like than what the inital project idea was looking for, oh and I got to include some ace mountain bike photos! Enjoyed the simplicity and problem solving to get 3 different cards with one not chosen!

Technology: React

---------------------------------

ToaDoo: https://whiskytoad.github.io/toadoo-list

Description: A simple todo list, added a dynamically created filter, animation for the sidebar and a hover over description.

Technology: Vanilla Javascript

----------------------------------------------

Odin Calculator: https://whiskytoad.github.io/odincalculator

Description: One of my first projects, just a simple calculator!

Technology: Vanilla Javascript
